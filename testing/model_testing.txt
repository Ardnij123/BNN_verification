Each model gets what was in previous
and makes adjustments to it


naive.py
    Naive solution using just definitions of BNN
    made in numpy
    works on +-1 as inputs

precomp.py
    Precomputed layers to work with 1 dot product and 1 bias add
    ~ 10 % faster? Maybe less on big layers

bylayer.py
    Computing whole layers simultaneously
    Merging of inputs on each layer output
    Usefull when no. of inputs >> layer bits combinations

binar.py
    Using bools as inputs

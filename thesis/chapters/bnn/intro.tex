\chapter{Binarised neural networks}

% Introduction to BNNs
Binary neural networks are a type of Deep neural networks where instead of floating
point numbers, binary values are used as inputs and outputs of layers.
This reduction of available values can lead to high reduction in the computation
time and energy consumption while achieving near state-of-the-art results~\cite{Hubara2016BinarizedNN}.

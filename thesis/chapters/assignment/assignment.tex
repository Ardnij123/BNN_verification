\chapter*{Thesis assignment}

ASP (Answer Set Programming) is a form of constraint programming designed
for solving various NP-complete search problems. It is often used
as an alternative to SAT/SMT solvers or symbolic algorithms based on BDDs
(Binary Decision Diagrams). Meanwhile, SAT/SMT and BDDs are one of the key
tools in current verification and validation workflows for binarised
neural networks (BNNs)~\cite{zhang2021bdd4bnn}. Conceptually, the goal of this thesis is therefore
to explore the possibilities of applying ASP to reason about the behaviour
of binarised neural networks. This should supplement the existing
SAT/SMT/BDD-based approaches.

More concretely, the student should familiarise themselves with the problem
of BNN robustness and the ASP method in general. They should then formulate
an ASP encoding of the BNN robustness problem such that the robustness of
a network can be validated using a suitable ASP solver (e.g.\ clingo~\cite{gebser2019multi}).
The student should then create a prototype implementation of this encoding
that will be tested on a collection of reasonable examples
(such as the ones from~\cite{zhang2021bdd4bnn}).

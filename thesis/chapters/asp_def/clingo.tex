\section{Clingo}\label{sec:clingo}

Clingo is an integrated ASP system, consisting of a grounder Gringo and solver
Clasp~\cite{aspEasy2016}.

If you are not familiar with the Clingo framework, see~\Cref{sec:clingo_language},
where I show basics of the
Clingo language, Gringo as translation from Clingo to Aspif language and
solving such program with Clasp.

\subsection{Clingo language}\label{sec:clingo_language}
Clingo language~\cite{gebser2019potassco} is used for transcribing ASP programs
in the Clingo system.
Clingo language does allow for facts, rules and constraints just like
the logic programs defined in this thesis. Clingo language is in fact
almost identical to the already provided notation.

\chapter{Answer set programming}

Answer set programming (ASP) is a form of declarative
programming oriented towards difficult, primarily NP-hard,
search problems~\cite{lifschitz2008answer}.
ASP is particularly suited for solving difficult combinatorial search problems%
~\cite{anger2005glimpse}.
ASP is somewhat closely related to propositional
satisfability checking (SAT)
in sense that the problem is represented as logic program. Difference is in
computational mechanism of finding solution.

I will be using framework Clingo~\cite{gebser2019potassco},
an integrated framework for solving ASP programs, for the implementation
part of this thesis. As ASP is significantly different from commonly used
programming languages, this section should introduce the readers to this paradigm
and familiarize them with this different representation of knowledge.
Each concept is first defined and then shown on examples.

Should there be ambiguity, please refer to~\cite{KRHandbook} for more examples.

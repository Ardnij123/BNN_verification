\chapter{Answer set programming}

Answer set programming (ASP) is a form of declarative
programming oriented towards difficult, primarily NP-hard,
search problems~\cite{lifschitz2008answer}.
ASP is particularly suited for solving difficult combinatorial search problems%
~\cite{anger2005glimpse}.
ASP is somewhat closely related to propositional
satisfability checking (SAT)
in sense that the problem is represented as logic program. Difference is in
computational mechanism of finding solution.

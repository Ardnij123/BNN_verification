\section{Evaluation of performance of the implemented framework}

In the last section, I have compared the performance of my framework
over different encodings of layers and constraints on the input.
In this section I proceed to evaluate 12 models of BNN classificators
trained on the MNIST dataset.

For the evaluation I have used following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \item Perceptron encoding: \Cref{enc:perc_direct_01}
    \item Output layer encoding: \Cref{enc:argmax_direct}
    \item Hamming encoding: \Cref{enc:fixed_direct}
    \item Fixed bit encoding: last $n-k$ bits fixed
    \item Base input instance: Instance 0
    \item Time limit: 600\,s
    \item Parallel threads: 8
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Over hamming distance}

Using my framework, I have evaluated robustness of all models over input region
based on the hamming distance of up to 4. The results of this evaluation
are shown in~\Cref{fig:eval_hamming_big}, values of the individual measurement
and of the computed robustness for these models are also in~\Cref{tab:eval_big_hamming}.
From the~\Cref{fig:eval_hamming_big} it seems that the framework has time complexity
close to linear to the size of the input region. Due to the limitations of Clingo
given by the inference algorithm based on enumeration of solutions,
the time complexity can not be lower than linear to the number of solutions
(the number of inputs with differing outputs).

\subsection{Over fixed bits}

Using my framework, I have evaluated robustness of all models over input regions
based on fixed bits with up to 24 free bits. The results of this evaluation
are shown in~\Cref{fig:eval_fixed_big}, values of the individual measurement
and of the computed robustness for these models are also in~\Cref{tab:eval_big_fixed}.
The time complexity seems to be similiar to the one of evaluation using
input region based on hamming distance.
The data does not suggest evaluation over any type of input region being significantly faster
than the other.

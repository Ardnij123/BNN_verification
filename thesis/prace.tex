        Deep neural networks are state-of-the-art technology.
        Using them in critical real-life applications carries a risk of failure.
        For this, verification of their properties is needed.
        This thesis explores the possibility for the use of answer set programming
        paradigm in this task. It implements a quantitative verificator for binarized neural
        net\-wo\-rks, a~special case of deep neural networks, using this paradigm.
        It also demonstrates the use of this verificator on a network
        trained on the MNIST dataset. The verificator proves to be especially
        good when evaluating highly robust networks.

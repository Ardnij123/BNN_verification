This directory contains precompiled files from the `/example/mu`
directory. These files are visually compared against fresh-compiled
files from the `/example/mu` directory.

By running `make UPDATE_FAILED=true`, the precompiled files will be
automatically replaced with fresh-compiled ones, if the two are
visually incompatible.
